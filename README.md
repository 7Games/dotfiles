### Things
Yes the background is literally just one pixel that is streched. I have no idea how to set the background to a colour so that's what I came up with.<br>
When you type in `neofetch` the ASCII art will be `gentoo_small` to change this go to `~/.config/neofetch/config.conf` and edit the `ascii_distro` to whatever your distro/os is.<br><br>
You are free to use these dotfiles for whatever you want, you don't even need to ask for permission or say that I created them.
